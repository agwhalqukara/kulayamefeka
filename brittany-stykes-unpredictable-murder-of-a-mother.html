She was shot and killed in 2013.&nbsp;</p><p>She was a sweet young lady. Brittany wanted to be the best mother in the world to her children.</p><p>The loss of her has devastated her family, and they want nothing more than to track down her killer.&nbsp;</p><p>Her daughter Aubree has recovered from her injuries, but continues to press detectives for details of her mother’s death.&nbsp;</p><p>In the house was her daughter, who was only 14 months old but managed to live.</p><p>Brittany’s murder and the family’s long wait for answers are explored in the concluding episode of Investigation Discovery’s ‘Still A Mystery: The Silent Witnesses.</p><p>If you’re curious about the outcome of this case, read on.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What happened to Brittany Stykes?</h2><p>On Wednesday, August 28, 2013, Brittany Stykes participated in an electronic job interview.</p><p>She decided to finish the discussion on the Internet at her mother-in-law’s house.&nbsp;</p><p>She was expecting her second child. Brittany left her work at Wal-Mart and stayed home with her family.</p><p>The 22-year-old woman was overjoyed to hear back from the Internal Revenue Service.&nbsp;</p><p>When the online interview ended, she was optimistic it had gone well.&nbsp;</p><p>After having a meal with her mother-in-law, she announced she would drop in on her parents later that evening.</p><p>At about 7:00 p.m., Brittany left her in-laws’ house with a plate laden with Shawn’s favorite leftovers.&nbsp;</p><p>She buckled her daughter Aubree into the car seat.</p><p>Brittany entered the driver’s seat of the family’s yellow Jeep Wrangler and set off toward Ripley.</p><p>Her father’s 49th birthday was that day. She visited him and wished him well before returning to her husband.</p><p>Unfortunately, she never got to see her husband.</p><p>Who discovered Brittany Stykes body?</p><p>Just after 8:00, a man traveling down US 68 was astonished to see headlights emerging from the woods on the other side of the road.</p><p>Worried, he turned around and stopped to look into the situation.</p><p>He stumbled upon a yellow Jeep whose engine was still functioning.</p><p>Shockingly, he saw a woman inside injured in a vehicle crash from the amount of blood she was coated in.&nbsp;</p><p>Her lips were bluish and she was slumped over the wheel. It was obvious she was not breathing.</p><p>In his call to 911, the man stated, “There’s a Jeep in the woods. Someone seemed to have fallen asleep while driving and crashed into the woods.”</p><p>As he waited for help, the man saw a toddler in the Jeep’s passenger seat.</p><p>The little girl was covered in blood but was awake and calling out for her mom.</p><p>Unbeknownst to him then, he had just stumbled across Brittany and Aubree.</p><p>Both Brittany and Aubree had been shot. So it was clear they were not dealing with a traffic accident.&nbsp;</p><p>Brittany was dead on the spot and sadly, nothing could have been done to save her.</p><p>Both she and the baby she was carrying passed away.&nbsp;</p><p>A medical team desperately worked to save Aubree’s life at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital.</p><p>She was rushed there by ambulance.</p><p>The five bullet holes in the Jeep’s driver-side door indicated someone fired from a distance.&nbsp;</p><p>Two bullets struck Brittany. The first pierced her neck and the second hit her chest and right arm.&nbsp;</p><p>The bullet that hit Aubree went through her forehead and out the top of her skull. After two quick operations, her condition miraculously improved, and her survival was predicted.</p><p>Sheriff’s Office deputies knocked on Shane’s door to inform him that his wife was dead.</p><p>Shane was instructed to join the deputies at the sheriff’s office after being reported.</p><p>The bystander, police, and Shane discovered Brittany’s body in her Jeep.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Brittany Stykes: Who killed her?</h2><p>In the show, police believes someone shot Brittany at point-blank range from outside the car.</p><p>After first questioning Shane, the authorities examined him for possible gun residue.&nbsp;</p><p>He cooperated with authorities and passed all polygraph exams, so they let him go.&nbsp;</p><p>However, the police have been skeptical regarding Shane. “I knew from the get-go that they suspected me,” he stated.</p><p>“To this day, there are still skeptics, and it bothers me that they exist. It hurts me so much.”</p><p>Shane claims he informed the police of the identity of the person he now suspects of murder.</p><p>According to him, he knew this person “not on a personal level.”&nbsp;</p><p>He complained to the police because he believed they were not acting on the tips he would give them.</p><p>Since the investigators’ leads eventually dried up, they could not make much progress.</p><p>In 2014, Shane stated his conviction that he could identify the murderer.</p><p>Shane didn’t name names but implied it was someone he knew.</p><p>Authorities believe this was not an isolated violence incident and are currently questioning other people of interest.</p><p>However, after the murder, the police couldn’t identify any suspects.</p><p>In 2015, the show’s protagonist’s girlfriend alleged that her lover had murdered Brittany in front of her eyes.</p><p>It was unable to confirm the assertions.&nbsp;</p><p>In May of 2021, Brittany’s dad said: “I know somebody out there knows what happened to my daughter. I hope the truth will emerge.”</p><p>He added, “Little Aubree keeps asking me about what happened to her mother and I hope I will have an answer for her one day.”&nbsp;</p><p>She is frequently inquiring about her mother. She had just turned one when this occurred.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite a prize being given for information that leads to an arrest, the Brittany Stykes case is yet to be solved.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Final words&nbsp;</h2><p>The police wouldn’t comment specifically on Shane’s tip but maintained that they hadn’t investigated further.&nbsp;</p><p>Reporters were informed that more than 70 leads had been investigated and that detectives were working on a theory they hoped would soon solve the case.</p><p>Unfortunately, their confidence was unwarranted since the matter is still open.</p><p>A representative said they were putting in more workforce and resources to find the murderer.</p><p>Someone, somewhere, has to know something.&nbsp;</p><p>They also disclosed an increase in the reward for information to $20,000.</p><p>The higher price and subsequent media boost did not result in significant new leads.</p><p>The police hasn’t been able to solve the case.</p><p>Detectives have been puzzling over whether the murderer had preplanned it all.</p><p>It was a terrible instance of mistaken identity or it was a random accident for the past nine years.</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunCu0aKrrZmernq0wNiknKxn</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./does-hibiscus-need-a-trellis.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Does Hibiscus need a trellis?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./b-smith.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>B.
