But is Madison, from Southern Charm, expecting a child? Here’s what we know so far.</p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Madison’s Pregnancy Scare on Season 8</h2><p>Madison LeCroy hinted in the Southern Charm season 9 trailer that she might be pregnant, causing viewers to speculate. She is seen in the trailer informing her husband that she is feeling queasy, and she subsequently visits a doctor to discuss her first pregnancy. Madison and her ex-partner, Josh Hughes, have a 10-year-old kid named Hudson.</p><p>Madison’s pregnancy speculations began in March 2023, when she posted an Instagram photo for an SKIMS campaign. She was holding a cocktail glass filled with milk from the SKIMS collection in the photo.</p><p>The comment “<a href=# rel=noopener>Drink up baby</a>” with a feeding bottle emoji piqued her followers’ interest, with many speculating that it was a pregnancy announcement. In answer to a fan’s question regarding whether she was expecting a child, Madison said, “Wouldn’t that be something?”</p>View this post on Instagram<p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none href=# rel=noopener>A post shared by Madison LeCroy (@madison.lecroy)</a></p><p style=text-align:justify></p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Madison’s Current Relationship Status</h2><p style=text-align:justify>On Southern Charm, Madison’s love life has been a roller coaster ride. She previously married Josh Hughes, her high school sweetheart, but the couple split in 2015. She then dated her co-star, Austen Kroll, for two years, but their relationship was turbulent and destructive, ending in 2020.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Madison also had a brief romance with another co-star, Craig Conover, which added to the show’s tension. Madison made headlines in 2021 when she was accused of having an affair with Alex Rodriguez, who was then engaged to Jennifer Lopez.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Madison denied sleeping with Rodriguez, but she did agree to exchange phone conversations and texts. Rodriguez and Lopez later divorced, although Madison maintained she had nothing to do with it.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Madison appears to be single and focused on her work and son in 2024. She has not confirmed any rumors of a new romance or uploaded any photographs or videos of a new lover on her social media sites. She has, however, hinted that she is interested in finding love again and that she is seeking someone devoted, honest, and respectful.</p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Madison Lecroy Age</h2><p style=text-align:justify>Madison Lecroy was born on October 6, 1990, thus she is 32 years old. She is from the American city of Greenville, South Carolina. She is passionately attached to her country’s culture and beliefs as an American citizen. Her parents, Ted and Tara Lecroy, raised Madison in and around South Carolina.</p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Madison Lecroy is Mourning a Great Loss</h2><p style=text-align:justify>Madison LeCroy announced her father, Ted LeCroy, died shortly before the new year. She posted a video montage, many of which were from her wedding to Brett Randle. There were words from her father to her spouse, messages from her father to her, and a cute video of Hudon as a toddler.</p>View this post on Instagram<p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none href=# rel=noopener>A post shared by Madison LeCroy (@madison.lecroy)</a></p><p style=text-align:justify></p><p style=text-align:justify>Madison had images of her family, as she was the youngest of three siblings, with an older brother and an older sister. She was extremely close to her father, and she frequently posted pictures of him on social media.</p><p style=text-align:justify>The Southern Charm cast has had a difficult year. Madison’s defeat is the latest in a string of setbacks for the Charmer squad. Olivia Flowers’ brother, Conner Flowers, died while Season 9 was in production. It was highly debated throughout the season, and it had a significant impact on Olivia.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Taylor Ann Green lost her brother, Worth Green, shortly after Season 9 ended. Despite their differences, Olivia stood by Taylor, understanding what it was like to lose a sibling. With the reunion approaching, it will be interesting to see how the cast interacts and if Madison LeCroy has a baby announcement.</p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Read the following posts to find out what other celebs are expecting:</strong></p><ul><li style=text-align:justify><a href=# rel=noopener>Is Kristen Cornett Pregnant?
