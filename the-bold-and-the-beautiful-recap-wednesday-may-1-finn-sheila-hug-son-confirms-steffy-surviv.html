Sheila embraced Finn back as Deacon watched the close mother-son moment.</p><p>Our B&B predictions point to Sheila and Finn’s bond stirring up plenty of trouble in his marriage to Steffy, so stay tuned!</p><p>At Forrester Creations, Ridge Forrester (Thorsten Kaye) noticed Steffy was distracted, so she ranted about Deacon messing with Finn’s head and decided to go shut him down.</p><p>At Il Giardino, Ivy Forrester (Ashleigh Brewer) hoped she didn’t overstep by kissing Liam Spencer (Scott Clifton) like that, but he clearly didn’t mind.</p><p>After more flirting, Ivy admitted this lengthy layover was mostly about reconnecting with Liam.</p><p>Once Ivy gushed over recent pics of Liam’s kids, he talked about co-parenting going well. Ivy ended up reminiscing with Liam about a romantic New Year’s Eve and other wonderful times together.</p><p>There was some talk about Liam’s willingness to marry Ivy to keep her from being deported and what an incredible guy he was.</p><p>Ivy often wondered what her life would be like if she hadn’t left California – and she hinted about having a million things she’d like to do with Liam if she didn’t have to catch her flight.</p><p>Liam flashed back to a romantic boat ride with Ivy, who showed him plenty of attention in the present, too.</p><p>After Ivy admitted she’d always had a little piece of Liam in her heart, she leaned in and gave him another kiss.</p><p>Steffy showed up looking for Deacon and witnessed that lip lock, so she seemed displeased.</p><p>Ivy decided she’d given Liam enough to think about for one day and added that any woman would be lucky to have him, including her. Steffy waltzed over moments later to point out that her cousin returned to town without telling her.</p><p>After Steffy asked if Ivy came all this way just to plant a big one on Liam, she called it “cute” and created some awkwardness at their table.</p><p>The Bold and the Beautiful spoilers say Steffy will fish for more news from Ivy soon, so we’ll bring you updates on the interrogation.</p><p>CDL’s where you want to be for exciting <a href=# rel=noopener>Bold and the Beautiful spoilers, predictions, updates and news, so visit us regularly for more B&B info.</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmdoaKpxq2t1Kebq7FemLyue5FpaW1npJ2ybq7OpZtmmZ6ZerW0xGaZnpmlqbanwctmqZ6bkaV6uLHDp5ysnJGueq6t2GZoZp6Zo7tuv8eeoKWZXZ3CqHnSqKVmm5%2Bjs6q%2BzKxkrKyVm7O6edKuqa%2Bhppqxbr%2FUoJirq12luaK6jg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./the-movie-10-years-after-its-release.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The Movie' 10 Years After Its Release</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./steelo-brim-biography-net-worth-wife-house-music-age-family-videos-son-movies-tv-shows-he.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Steelo Brim Biography: Net Worth, Wife, House, Music, Age, Family, Videos, Son, Movies, TV Shows, He</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./find-nootrobox-hvmn-net-worth-revenue.html>Find Nootrobox (HVMN) Net Worth/Revenue</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fixer-to-fabulous-star-joe-looney-s-age-explored.html>Fixer to Fabulous star Joe Looneys age explored</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lamar-odom-and-aaron-carter-share-back-and-forth-trash-talking-ahead-of-their-upcoming-boxing-match.html>Lamar Odom And Aaron Carter Share Back-And-Forth Trash Talking Ahead Of Their Upcoming Boxing Match</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./was-joy-sunday-in-black-panther.html>Was Joy Sunday in Black Panther?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-is-julia-bradbury-net-worth-2024-income-charity-work-investments-and-much-more.html>What is Julia Bradbury Net Worth 2024: Income, Charity Work, Investments and Much More</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DashVibe.
