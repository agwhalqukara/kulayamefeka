During last night’s Battle Round, John Legend revealed that <a href=# rel=noopener>two former contestants fell in love</a> while competing on his team and are now happily married.</p><p>The surprising news came as Bri Fletcher and Serenity Arce from <a href=# rel=noopener>Chance The Rapper’s team</a> prepared to<strong>&nbsp;</strong>face off in the Battles. The two girls explained how they had grown very close and were sad that one of them would be eliminated. Legend agreed and noted that teammates often form strong bonds, using his former team members as an example.</p><p>Although the “All of Me” singer didn’t state who the contestants are, some digging on social media proves that he was talking about John Holiday and Rio Souma, who competed on Season 19 of The Voice. Holiday made it far on the show and finished in fifth place, while Souma did not make it past the Battle Rounds. It was a happy ending for both men, however, as they met their future partners through the show.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/The-Voice-3.jpg alt="The Voice" width=1078 height=629 sizes="(min-width: 100rem) 1000px, (min-width: 91rem) 681px, (min-width: 48rem) 450px, (max-width: 48rem) 250px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>The couple got married in August 2022 in Houston, Texas. Holiday celebrated their nuptials on Instagram, sharing <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">several photos</a> of the lavish ceremony. “Fresh off of our honeymoon, I’d love to share a few more photos with you, from our Celestial Dream. It was TRULY a fairytale….more to come,” he wrote in the caption.</p><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">CelebMix</a> ahead of the wedding, Holiday opened up about the early days of their relationship. “During our time on The Voice, even though we were not technically supposed to be in each other’s room, I’d go over to his room to ask about bantu knots. So, Rio would put bantu knots into my hair, we’d watch movies and learn about each other,” he told the outlet. “In the most beautiful way, it was the most intimate that I’ve ever been with anyone in my life.”</p><p>He continued, “That relationship has changed my life. It opened my eyes even more to possibilities that love, in fact, was still available to me. That fairytale endings are happening all around me. Love finds a way through and through. Honestly, it’s the most beautiful love story.”</p><p>Since leaving the show, Holiday has released three singles: “Alive in Me,” “Love Finds A Way” and “Waste Mine,” the latter of which was inspired by his relationship with Souma. “I believed that it was the closest representation of what I felt about him and our budding relationship,” Holiday said of the song. “For me, it was such a specific fairytale story that I believed was happening in my life. All at once, the song represents the butterflies I felt about Rio’s and my new relationship, but it also showed that love was possible.”</p><p>Holiday and Souma are not the only contestants who have found love on The Voice. <a href=# rel=noopener>Season 24 contestant Tom Nitti</a> and Season 25 contestant Ashley Bryant met through the show, as their respective seasons were filmed at the same time. The couple got engaged in February 2024, just before Bryant’s Blind Audition aired. “I never believed in the ‘one day it will all make sense’ quote until now. My heart is so full ❤️,” Bryant wrote alongside <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">photos from their engagement</a>. Like her now-fiancé, Bryant is a country singer and she is currently competing on Reba McEntire’s team.</p><p>Season 25 of The Voice airs on NBC on Mondays and Tuesdays at 8 p.m. EST and streams on <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Peacock</a>.</p><p><b>Get to know the <a href=# rel=noopener>contestants on Season 25 of The Voice</a> in the gallery below.&nbsp;</b></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn5a9tHrSoZykpp%2BswG%2BvzqZmrKeRpcBwusSwqmhvYmh%2FeXyOo6ahpl2dvK21w5qwZqqZpHq0u9SmmGasmJp6t7vInJxo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./friend-as-to-the-lgbtq-community.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Friend as to the LGBTQ community</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./claudia-mars-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Claudia Mars Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./find-nootrobox-hvmn-net-worth-revenue.html>Find Nootrobox (HVMN) Net Worth/Revenue</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fixer-to-fabulous-star-joe-looney-s-age-explored.html>Fixer to Fabulous star Joe Looneys age explored</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lamar-odom-and-aaron-carter-share-back-and-forth-trash-talking-ahead-of-their-upcoming-boxing-match.html>Lamar Odom And Aaron Carter Share Back-And-Forth Trash Talking Ahead Of Their Upcoming Boxing Match</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./was-joy-sunday-in-black-panther.html>Was Joy Sunday in Black Panther?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-is-julia-bradbury-net-worth-2024-income-charity-work-investments-and-much-more.html>What is Julia Bradbury Net Worth 2024: Income, Charity Work, Investments and Much More</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DashVibe.
