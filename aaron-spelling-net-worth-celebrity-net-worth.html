He grew up with mother Pearl, father David (a tailor), sister Becky, and brothers Sam, Max, and Daniel. His parents were Russian-Jewish immigrants, and David changed his last name from Spurling to Spelling after he emigrated to America. Aaron was the victim of anti-Semitic bullying by his classmates, leading to a nervous breakdown at 8 years old, where he psychosomatically lost the ability to use his legs; he stayed in bed for a year, passing his time with books, and fully recovered. Spelling attended Forest Avenue High School, then served as an Army Air Corps pilot during World War II, earning a Purple Heart after being shot in the hand by a sniper.</p><p>After his military service was over, Aaron attended Southern Methodist University, graduating with a journalism degree in 1949. As an SMU student, he joined the drama club and showed his school spirit as head cheerleader; he was also the first student to direct a senior class play at the school. Spelling earned a Harvard Award in 1947 for a play he wrote about racial prejudice and won the award again in 1949. In 1998, SMU honored Aaron with their Distinguished Alumni Award.</p><h2 id=early-career><strong>Early Career</strong></h2><p>In 1953, Spelling made his acting debut in the film noir "Vicki" and appeared on "Dragnet" and "I Led Three Lives."

He took Spelling Entertainment public in 1986, and the public offering raised $80 million, allowing Spelling to pump out many more productions into the 2000s.</p><p>In the first decade of his producing career, Aaron served as an executive producer on several TV series, including "The <a href=# title="Lloyd Bridges Net Worth">Lloyd Bridges</a> Show" (1962-1963), "Burke's Law" (1963-1966), "The Smothers Brothers Show" (1965-1966), and "The Mod Squad" (1968-1973). He went on to produce long-running shows&nbsp; "Charlie's Angels" (1976âˆ’1981), "Fantasy Island" (1977âˆ’1984), "Dynasty" (1981â€“1989), "Beverly Hills, 90210" (1990âˆ’2000), "Melrose Place" (1992âˆ’1999), "7th Heaven" (1996âˆ’2006), and "Charmed" (1998-2006).
