Between 1959 to 1970, honorees gathered in Los Angeles, Beverly Hills, New York City, Nashville and Chicago for the ceremonies.</p><p>When the Grammys eventually changed their format, they became a big hit with audiences at home. Late, great stars <a href=#>Frank Sinatra</a>, <a href=#>Jerry Lewis</a> and <a href=#>Kenny Rogers</a> took the stage to emcee some of the earliest awards shows. As the years went on, movie stars and musicians alike tried their hand at hosting “music’s biggest night.”</p><p>Late singer Andy Williams holds the record for <a href=#>most frequent Grammys host</a> having taken up the role from 1971 to 1977. Following closely behind is LL Cool J, who hosted five ceremonies from 2012 to 2016. When <a href=#><strong>James Corden</strong></a> took over the gig the following year, the NCIS actor was at peace with the choice.</p><p>“They wanted to do something different, and I actually felt totally comfortable with that,” he told <a href=#>Billboard</a> magazine in February 2017. “I had an amazing run on the Grammys. I’m good. I made some great friends, I have friends at the Academy, friends on the production team, the executives.”</p><p>Though the awards often appear to be a well-oiled machine, sometimes things don’t always go as planned. Before she hosted the 62nd annual Grammys from Los Angeles in January 2020, <a href=#><strong>Alicia Keys</strong></a> was forced to make some quick changes to her routine in the wake of <a href=#>Kobe Bryant’s tragic death</a>. She performed an a cappella version of “It’s So Hard to Say Goodbye to Yesterday” with Boyz II Men to <a href=#>pay tribute to the NBA player</a> at the Staples Center, where he’d played as a Laker.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I think that it was definitely a crazy feeling because, literally minutes before, we were going to do something else,” the “Underdog” singer said on <a href=#>The Ellen DeGeneres Show </a>days after the Grammys took place. “And we had to really figure out how can we properly honor him in his house on this night [with] everybody who adores him and loves him so much and has been inspired by him and felt so devastated in that moment.”</p><p>Keep scrolling for a look back at some of the most notable Grammys hosts through the years.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2Bcv6K5zLKqZqCfqMG0edOhqaitl516tbTEZrCemaKoeqa4y56lZpyVnLKvsdGeqmaknGKwsLvLZqFmpZ%2BnsnA%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./j-crew-s-double-discount-sale-includes-spring-fashion-up-to-83-off.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>J.Crews Double-Discount Sale Includes Spring Fashion Up to 83% Off</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./ulissesworld-height-and-weight-how-tall-is-the-fitness-influencer-have.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Ulissesworld Height And Weight - How Tall Is The Fitness Influencer Have?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./find-nootrobox-hvmn-net-worth-revenue.html>Find Nootrobox (HVMN) Net Worth/Revenue</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fixer-to-fabulous-star-joe-looney-s-age-explored.html>Fixer to Fabulous star Joe Looneys age explored</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lamar-odom-and-aaron-carter-share-back-and-forth-trash-talking-ahead-of-their-upcoming-boxing-match.html>Lamar Odom And Aaron Carter Share Back-And-Forth Trash Talking Ahead Of Their Upcoming Boxing Match</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./was-joy-sunday-in-black-panther.html>Was Joy Sunday in Black Panther?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-is-julia-bradbury-net-worth-2024-income-charity-work-investments-and-much-more.html>What is Julia Bradbury Net Worth 2024: Income, Charity Work, Investments and Much More</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DashVibe.
