Thom Yorke, the band’s vocalist, and songwriter is well known among fans for his dislike towards platforms like YouTube and Spotify. And because of it, many were wondering if the account was just an April fools’ joke since the date aligned perfectly.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>The account is verified and soon dispelled any doubts regarding the account’s authenticity. Radiohead has remained active since joining TikTok and recently uploaded a cryptic video of Chieftain Mews narrating, a section of their ‘Weird Fishes’ track from their album&nbsp;In Rainbows.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>To add a more mysterious flair to the clip, Chieftain Mews, known for his trademark bald cap, has a head full of hair waving around as if he’s underwater. And during the entire clip, a fish keeps on swimming into his chest and disappearing on loop. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Radiohead’s Cryptic TikTok Clips</h2><p>Since joining TikTok at the beginning of April, Radiohead has posted multiple cryptic videos, all of which feature Chieftain Mews delivering news. His desk has his name written on it, and behind him is the band’s logo.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>The clips are all in black and white, except for a rainbow on the top part of the Radiohead logo. Mews’s voice is deep and rich, and the video has a grainy/noisy look to it. But Radiohead’s dystopian touch doesn’t stop there. Every once in a while, shrill and disturbing sounds play in the background.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Radiohead’s&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">first clip</a>&nbsp;on TikTok featured Chieftain Mews just talking to the camera after a mysterious voice instructs him to say something. Mews asks the voice what it wants him to say before saying tick tock repeatedly. “Tick Tock tick tock tick tock tick tock. This is your wake up call. Have a good day.” <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Their other videos have been equally cryptic, with one being nothing but Mews&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">repeatedly saying</a>&nbsp;‘Hello’ to the camera while disturbing music plays in the background.&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Another one</a>&nbsp;featured their most significant hit, ‘Creep,’ which was slowed down. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Radiohead On TikTok</h2><p>Waves of indie artists have joined TikTok as it has established itself as a platform where artists can gain exposure and generate revenue. It’s still unclear why Radiohead joined the platform. Many fans have&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">speculated</a>&nbsp;that it’s to tease their next work.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Backing up that idea is Radiohead guitarist Ed O’Brien’s assurance about the band reconvening to make a new album. The guitarist had told&nbsp;NME&nbsp;that everyone in the band was doing their own thing but would plus back into Radiohead when they felt it was time. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>So far, their content on&nbsp;TikTok&nbsp;has either just been purely mysterious, or an homage-esque video to their past works. There have been no announcements regarding Radiohead’s next project, and it’s entirely possible that the band joining TikTok had no deeper meaning.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGikrquZmHyzrcOipqGdkZl6sbvSrZydZaSnrqS3jKKlZqqRnruju9asZK2hm6m8rHrHraSl</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./tom-joyner-net-worth-2024-age-height-weight-wife-kids-bio-wiki.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Tom Joyner Net Worth 2024: Age, Height, Weight, Wife, Kids, Bio-Wiki</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./movies-directed-by-andy-tennant.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Movies directed by Andy Tennant</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./find-nootrobox-hvmn-net-worth-revenue.html>Find Nootrobox (HVMN) Net Worth/Revenue</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fixer-to-fabulous-star-joe-looney-s-age-explored.html>Fixer to Fabulous star Joe Looneys age explored</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lamar-odom-and-aaron-carter-share-back-and-forth-trash-talking-ahead-of-their-upcoming-boxing-match.html>Lamar Odom And Aaron Carter Share Back-And-Forth Trash Talking Ahead Of Their Upcoming Boxing Match</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./was-joy-sunday-in-black-panther.html>Was Joy Sunday in Black Panther?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-is-julia-bradbury-net-worth-2024-income-charity-work-investments-and-much-more.html>What is Julia Bradbury Net Worth 2024: Income, Charity Work, Investments and Much More</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DashVibe.
