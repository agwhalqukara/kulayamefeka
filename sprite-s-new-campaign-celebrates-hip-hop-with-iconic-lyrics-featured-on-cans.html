Examples of famous lines from artists are: Drakes "Know Yourself, Know Your Worth," Nas's "The World Is Yours," Rakim's "Thinking Of A Master Plan," and "Lyrically Supposed I'm To Represent," by B.I.G.</p><p>Sounds like a great start to a new collection of cans as antiques that someday might be worth some money.</p><p>According to a press release from the Coca-Cola Company, artists were selected based on their reputation for being true to themselves through their music, and advancing the culture.

"By honoring and recognizing great lyricism from some of the genre's biggest icons on our product packaging, we're demonstrating how Sprite continues to support Hip Hop artists that remain true to themselves."</p><p>Rumors have been spreading that Drake will appear in a new TV commercial during the coverage of the NBA Finals, set to debut as soon as this weekend, which would be his first since the "Spark" commercial airing in 2010. Although it's never a simple process to&nbsp;license lyrics for commercial use, especially when dealing with multiple publishers, Paige claims that the entire process was&nbsp;completed with ease.</p><p>"We were able and very fortunate to work with some amazing partners, who took what could have been a very long and extensive process and made it easy –&nbsp;they really hit it out of the ballpark," she says.</p><p>Is it possible that any southern MC's will make the cut for Sprite's next edition of "Obey Your Verse?"
